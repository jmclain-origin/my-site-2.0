# Thraot Full of Glass

Beyond true will

We seek comfort in a broken heart

Now Patterns shape an image of true life

Alone surrounded by a million faces

One by one, I see the judgement in their eyes

Like a disease, Im always in the wrong

Now the numbness wearing off can't stand the pain

I get in line, I always do

Need to be patient while perfecting Death's design

I cannot help it, I can't decline

It's always better down the line

I'm in the wrong and I've done this all before

And I wish I never been

And I know it's just a dream

Now that I'm blind I can open my eyes

Can't stay awake, burning alive

I cannot breathe this posioned air is filled with lies

I cannot see what gone to to me

Live in fear the sun is falling from the sky

Can't stay awake

Nothing left to break

My life is in a thousend pieces

A million reasons

Why should I keep myself awake

Hard to define, it always is

Its hard to scream with a throat full of glass
